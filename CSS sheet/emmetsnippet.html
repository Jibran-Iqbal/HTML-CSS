        <span style="font-size: 175%; font-weight:bold; color:white; background:red"> Press Ctrl+Space to get emmet suggestions<br>In an emmet suggestion we can press read more or info to see what we are going to get in advance This can be helpful when using emmet snippets</span>

        <span style="color:red;background:black;font-size:150%";>
            After typing an element's name if it is followed by a dot and then a random word then that random word becomes its class name
        <br>
            for example:=<br>h1.main.second
            <br>
            This will be followed by pressing the tab key
        <br>
        </span>
        <span style="color:blue;background:yellow;font-size:150%;">
            After typing an element's name if it is followed by a hashtag(#) and then a random word then that random word becomes its id
            name. This seems to be limited to one id only
            <br>
            for example:=<br>h2#main
            <br>
            This will be followed by pressing the tab key
        </span>
        <span style="background:coral;font-size:150%;">
            After typing an element's name if it is followed by a hashtag(#) and a then a random word and then a dot and then another random word then that random word becomes its id name and the other one becomes its class
            name. This seems to be limited to one id only
            <br>
            for example:=<br>h2.main#main.secondary
            <br>
            This will be followed by pressing the tab key
        </span>
        <span style="background:cyan;font-size:150%;">
            However with a div this is alot easier. All we have to do is type class name or id name or both with dot or hashtag or both and then press tab
            <br>
            for example:=<br>.main#main.secondary
            <br>
            This will be followed by pressing the tab key
        </span>
        <span style="color:blue;font-size:150%;">
            We can also create children with div
            <br>
            The syntax will be as follows:=<br>div>ul>li
            <br>
            This will be followed by pressing the tab key
            <br>
            <span style="background: yellow;">
                However this is not limited to just ul and li and it is also not limited to just one list item
            <br>
                We can use multiplication symbol to increase the number of the list items
                The syntax will be as follows:=
            <br>
                div>ul>li*5
            <br>
                This will be followed by pressing the tab key  
            </span>
        </span>
        <span style="background-color:rgb(0,255,0); color:black;font-size:150%;">
            We can also have text added in our element. The syntax is simply using curly braces
            <br>
            for example:=<br>p{some text}
            <br>
            div{some text}
            <br>
            span{some text}
            <br>
            This will be followed by pressing tab key
        </span>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: 150%; background:rgb(0,150,255)">
            We can also combine it all
            <br>
            for example:=<br>div>ul>li*6{$}
            <br>
            The dollar sign here is for numbers 1-6
        </span>
